Week One in Provo!,The provo MTC is very cool and very pretty. It's been a very fun and exciting week. This week I got to meet my district and teachers in person which was amazing. I can now see them all clearly and hear them quite well.They are all also very amazing missionaries and have quickly become my best friends. I will stand by the fact that I have the best district. Just last night during a testimony meeting we made the Branch president cry from the amazing spirit felt. The spirit is everywhere and with everyone here it is so amazing. Sunday was the most spirit filled day of my life. I woke up with the spirit talking to me during my scripture study and for priesthood and for sacrament and then the whole time for the go and do experience. We then shared our testimonies and what we learned that day and the spirit was so strong we were all on a spiritual high. It was fantastic till the next morning when I was so exhausted. üòÇ The food here doesn't taste bad but it is definitely not the most nutritious and healthy food. I have been walking up and down many many stairs and then working out and playing lots of beach volleyball and court volleyball so lots of exercise and no nutrition means I shrink a whole size in everything my arms used to fit nicely in the shirt i am wearing as of 4 days ago and now it's slightly baggy my belts go tighter and my legs no longer fill my pants. I have grown spiritually but that's it. Hopefully I don't shrink too much more or I will be just bones. üíÄ Last night we got back to our resident hall and there were snails in the shower. It was very funny but also very gross. Some of the boys in my district and I took a picture with one of the snails in the shower. It was great. So as i mentioned before been playing lots of volleyball I played basketball once and turns out MTC basketball in not very friendly and fun basketball i got hurt twice and shoved over many times that's why volleyball is the move I also destroy at volleyballüí™ I miss home and friends and family but I am still doing great still surviving and enjoying life. Sounds like I will probably be getting reassigned at some point and I am actually looking forward to it so I can have more time to master my spanish. I love you all thankyou for all your prayers!‚ù§
I'M ALIVE,This week has been a week. I am dying but living my best life. I love being spiritually fed and growing my knowledge in the church and in spanish but oh how tiring it can be and mentally physically and emotionally draining. In the cleaning closet by my room I found one of those things that weighs your suitcase. It went to 110 pounds but then looped around if it was higher and I wanted to know how much weight I have lost because I shrunk so much. So me being me decided to hang on the little hook on the end of it to weigh myself and it worked surprisingly well. So before I left here to the MTC I was 155 pounds and I am now 140. I have lost 15 pounds in less than two weeks so all you all that thought I was joking when I said I shrunk there you go. This week has been full of a bunch of crazy experiences! Starting on Thursday we were in full immersion so every class is fully in spanish and you just gotta figure it out on your own what the teachers are saying and it takes a lot of focus and energy to do that. I swear my brain muscles are working so hard that my head literally gets hot. So for one of the practices we went to a different building than normal to these little rooms with three chairs and we were told that you and your companion are going to teach a lesson to someone right now with no preparation nothing and this is our third day of full spanish! So everyone left a room except me and my companion and another companionship. We were blessed by having to wait till another room opened so we got time to kinda prepare a lesson. So me being an anxious pooper (sorry not sorryTMI) I had to run the bathroom as I was washing my hands I had the weirdest feeling to say a prayer out loud and in spanish and in my prayer I prayed for the gift of tongues and went to my lesson i walked in the room sat down and started to talk. I have no idea what I said and still don't. I didn't even realize I was talking that much but after the class in my room my companion told me I did so great and that I thought it was a fantastic lesson and he only said about two words and I took the rest. I was like oh my gosh I did do that! I didn't even know! little did I realize that my propted prayer was answered! It was amazing. I am sorry if you are bored and don't want to hear more but one more thing! Elder and Sister Godoy came to the MTC yesterday to speak at the general Authority devotional! They both gave fantastic talks and I may have cried but I am going to focus on the end of Sister Godoy's talk. She shared the scripture 1st Nephi 3:15 this is the Nephi and his brothers going to get the gold plates and their first attempt failed. Leman and Lemuel  were wanting to go back and be done because it was hard for them but Nephi said we will not go back till the lords are done. It has been very hard and I want to go home all the time but the lord has called me and I will not go home till I have done what the lord has asked me. I am in this for the long game not what I want now. The eternal blessings are going to be so crazy and I can't wait to get them! Again Thank you all for all your support! I would love to hear from everyone! I wanna know how life is! See ya next week!
Howdy Y'all,Nothing crazy has happened this week so this will probably be a short email.  Thursday Friday and Saturday were all pretty boring. just classes. food and classes. My spanish is getting slightly better though so that's nice me and my comp and I have been trying new things to help us study which has been quite helpful actually. On Sunday I got the opportunity to fast and then go and chill out on the temple grounds with my super cool district and then to cap it all off we served dinner to all the starving missionaries. Fasting as a missionary is very easy because you have so much to fast for and you have stuff to do all day so you are distracted and not thinking about how empty your stomach is. So they just straight up don't serve breakfast and lunch on fast Sundays so for lunch they told us we should go to the temple grounds and hangout there for that time. It was very nice to get to know my district better and be on holy grounds and feel the spirit a little bit as well. After the Go and do experience that we have every Sunday my district got chosen to serve all the starving fasting missionaries for dinner and it was actually really fun to do. Me and my companion got to run the salad bar and fill up all the stuff that ran out and talk to some people that were in line. Then Monday was Monday nothing crazy exciting. But Tuesday for our Tuesday devotional Garry E. Sevenson came and talked to us with his wife and they both had super amazing talks and I felt the spirit the whole time. Being in the same room as a quorum of the 12 is so cool! Him and his wife both talked about the importance of missionary work and the fact that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love all of us not just us missionaries but everyone. Elder Stevenson also mentioned twice that we are here where Heavenly Father wants us as missionaries which is always super comforting to hear especially from a quorum of the 12. Also this morning I got to go to the temple and as a missionary it was so fantastic. Felt the spirit and had some really cool personal revelation! I have been trying a little too hard to be a really good missionary and not really be me and I felt strongly that I should just be a better me but stay true to myself. The lord called me for me. In the Words of Elder Stevenson "As a missionary like in the Lego Movie Everything is awesome" It may be hard at times and I may struggle a lot with Spanish or whatever it is but I grow with every trial and question I have and that is awesome even though it's hard. My district is amazing and I can't stress enough how lucky I am to have them and as amazing as it was to see and as it was to see a quorum of the 12 the district devotional review after is probably better then the devotional itself. Everyone in my district shares and they are all super amazing thoughts they all have amazing testimonies and they have helped me grow mine. Also side note my amazing mother sent me a package with protein stuff in it and I am happy to report some of my weight and muscles are returning.
Down in Ohio!,Okay so three hours or so after I sent the email something interesting happened! After class and our zone prayer some guys told my companion that they would pay him 40$ to go lay down in the fountain so guess what he did. Laid down in the fountain and got his 40$ I asked him and told him not to but oh well I ran away and watched from a distance and then I lost him when I tried to go find him after and saw wet footprints on the cement followed them and found him so that was great. On Friday I got done with dinner and wasn't feeling too good so I was in the bathroom and just threw up so much I filled the toilet. It was so much fun I suspect food poisoning because the next day I still wasn't feeling great either. But now I am fine. And then Also on Friday I got my reassignment!! I am going to Cincinnati Ohio. We all know all these memes about Ohio. I will soon be able to confirm or deny those in about a week! I have already heard great things about where I am going so that makes me even more excited! I am also happy I won't be fully Spanish and I can drink the water and have the food. My Spanish is definitely improving. We had an English fast on Monday where we couldn't speak any English and it went very well. I barely spoke any Spanish and I learned a lot. It also made me realize how much and how little of Spanish I know! We also start SYL (speak your language) tonight we're for the next week. All I can speak is my language. spanish! That's my update for spanish! On Sunday we had the coolest Sunday devotion ever! It was a live music concert from Jenny Oaks Baker! Dallin H Oaks daughter that has a grammy for playing the violin! Her and her family all make music and they came and played us s music and shared some really cool messages! The spirit was so strong and it all mostly came from their music! Music has been a very talked about topic and a lot of the devotionals here! Music is very awesome! Then we had our Tuesday Devotional Elder and Sister Nattres of the 70. They both gave really awesome tales and shared cool messages and stories. They talked a lot about the scripture Mark 5:36 "Be not afraid Only Believe". It is a fantastic scripture. At the end of the devotional they gave us a card that had that scripture on it and challenged us to carry it with us. It is always in the bag that I carry every day. He also challenged us to share  within the next 24 hours "what we think ye of Christ". So here is what I think of Christ. He is my friend my best friend always there for me and loves me so incredibly much He would do anything for me and for you. He is our Savior and made it so that we can get back to Heavenly Father in heaven and live with him again. He is the perfect example for us to follow in everything and the best teacher to ever live. He teaches with questions and helps us grow on our own. My testimony has grown an unbelievable amount and is still growing. I love it here at the MTC even though it is super super repetitive and it is hard to wake up and get out of bed some morning. I know I am supposed to be here and that I am doing the right thing here. One more scripture Jacob 6:12 it sums up what we all need to do. Thank you all for all the support. again I would love to hear from you guys!
I am Outta Here!,This week hasn't been very exciting. it has actually been kinda very slow because I am so excited to leave and be out in the field! I have heard so many things about Ohio and Cincinnati it makes me super super excited! I also heard that Bolivian visas are getting sent out which is so awesome because that means I can be in Bolivia soon! I have been learning a lot and my spanish and testimony continue to grow more and more everyday! Also thank you to those that Emailed me. I loved hearing from you! Yesterday was a crazy day. I had to say goodbye to my branch president who I loved and also the amazing Hermano Philips AKA Lachy! As an Adios to us Lachy had some tips and stories for us to help us in the field which I really appreciated and learned a lot from. I am making this Email short because I totally forgot to start my email and now do not have much time to type it up! Quick spiritual thought. We had a devotional last night from Elder Nash and it was so fantastic! Near the end of his talk he talked about the Atonement and Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. He talked about how Jesus asked God to take away the hard thing that he was about to do if it was God's will. God's will was for him to do the hard thing but he was sent an angle to help lift him up and strengthen him at this time. I have gone through hard times and will continue to have hard times but I know I have had angels sent to me to strengthen me and lift me up. I invite you all to pray for angels and to see the angels in your life thank god from them and let those angels know that you appreciate them! Hope you all have a good week! I would love to hear from you guys!
Cussed at on my first day and a Baptism?,Hello people! I am in Ohio!! Its crazy being out in the mission field! But I love it! I arrived in Ohio on the 21st and spent the night at the mission presidents house with 20 other Elders it was great. I slept on the top bunk of the middle of three bunks in a small room and the fan was right above me so if I were to lift my foot about a foot it would have hit the fan. Then the next morning went to the mission office which is also a church had breakfast and were told rules and had some orientation. And then we got our trainers! I got assigned to the Cincinnati spansih area with Elder Glade and Elder Donnaldson as a trio! They are both super dope and patient they help me with my spanish all the time which I appreciate a ton! Ohio is so pretty and very cool there are tons of trees! We are also in a very hilly part of Cincinnati so that's also fun would hate to be a biking missionary in this area. I get to be in a car and drive around its fantastic. So we only talk to Latinos because they speak spanish. We find Latinos by walking around places like Home depot or laundromats and there are some spanish stores around we walk around the stores trying to find peopel and we just chill in the parking lot and wait for people but the first day I just watched them do their stuff and then I wrote some notes in my book of Mormon to help for when I do it and the next day I did a few more things I started a few conversations but that's all. Yesterday I did a little more I started more conversations and held them for as long as I could! It was great. So on my first day of prosoliting we went to Home Depot and I got cussed at for wearing too nice of clothes in Home Depot and then later that night my trainers had a baptism for someone so I got to go be apart of that it was crazy cool! Jose was baptized and then confirmed a member Yesterday at church it was so cool! I have helped teach some lessons already as well as in help I mean I bear my testimony and ask some questions. It is still fun though! I am learing a ton and still growing! We have a new friend that we have been teaching his name is Billy he is super cool and invested he doesn't have any problems with alcohol or smoking which are two of the biggest problems we would run into! We have some more lessons scheduled and hope to get more peopel interested in going to church soon! I am still sick and don't seem to be getting much better which makes the work a little bit harder especially because I am tired all the time but I am surviving. Shopping for myself and cooking my own food is kinda a fun new thing that I have found I not very good at but my companions have helped me with that as well so that's nice. Little spiritual thought for the Email. We as a companionship pray all the time it is amazing! Every time we wake up we say a prayer together (all prayers are in spanish ) and then we pray individually. And we pray before we eat and every time we start a study either personal or companionship. We pray every time we leave our apartment and every time we leave the car to prosolite to people. And then we pray to as we go to bed and then separately. We pray to start every lesson and all that stuff. So as I said we pray all the time and its the best thing ever because prayer is a direct conversation with God! And he loves to hear from us and wants to bless us all the time! He may bless us in ways we don't recognize but when we do recognize them we thank him for it and show him appreciation for that blessing! Prayer is so important and will give you so many blessings just like reading The Book of Mormon I hope you all will continue to pray or start praying and reading the Book of Mormon they are fantastic! I love you all hope you are all doing well! Send me emails love to hear from you all!
Hipop√≥tamo y Monos,First full week! Let's goooooooo! Its been crazy out here! Mt spanish is improving a ton and I have been enjoying the work so much! My companions are fantastic they make the work so much much more fun while teaching me tons at the same time and pushing me out of my comfort zone just a little to grow more everyday! Ohio is still crazy and I still love it. Lots of trees lots of people and tons of fun. interesting. and spiritual moments! So let's start with the fun shall we! Got a few embarrassing moments but nothing too bad. On Tuesday after distric council and all that we went out to find some Latinos to talk to as we normally do we found a lady at a bus stop who agreed to another lesson and then we went over to the other side of town because we had a lesson there and started talking to people there and got 3 people to agree to another lesson within 30 minutes it was awesome! And then we went and had a great lesson on the porch of Hildas house with her her family and a friend! It was kinda crazy because there were kids running around and they live on a busy street but they took thr lesson and put Invitations very well! I have a ton of stories so I am going to just highlight because this would be a crazy long email if I didn't. We went to these apartments on a busy street we looked at people mailboxs and looked at names to see if any of them looked to be Latinos. If they looked like it we would would knock on their door. we were in this apartment it was very sketchy and eire so it was a but tense so we go to knock on a door when thr door next to it opens and we all jumped and an d lady walked out and we asked her if she had neighbors that spoke spanish and she said room 11 so we went there. We knocked on the door in the hot hallway the as we silently waited for hopefully some Latino to answer and hopefully not yell at us and shoot us because we were in a sketchy place I let out a fart... I was leaned up against the wall so it vibrated on the wall and echoed done the hallway we started dying of laughter luckily no one answered we wouldn't have been able talk. Okay now highlights I had tons of yummy food and funny conversations with people and members especially the Berchanos! I pooped my pants. Had some interesting stories told to me by random people. We ran into the same guy 3 times in one day at different places. My companions are goobers. And Ohio is full of crazy people and things. And General Conference was the best!! Out prophet is the coolest! Now to be spiritual after that. We have our Amigo Jos√© he just got baptized last week and we are now doing the after lessons just to make sure he understands what he was thought before he is very cool and fun to talk to even though I can't talk to him that much because my spanish is still not very good. We had a lesson with him last week and it was the first time I felt the spirit in a spanish lesson because my spanish although it sucks is getting much much better and I can understand more and speak a little more no where near enough but we are getting there. And then obviously Conference was amazing I shed a few tears because everything as a missionary just hits different. I want to share some of My favorite things that I heard. Obviously start with our prophet Think celestial! That's thr coolest thing I have heard and as he explained it I know that if we do this it will be game changing as he said it would be! I would invite you all to go back and study that talk more because it was crazy! Also as I on my mission and things get hard I want to know spanish I want this or that but I am constantly reminded that I am on the lords time not mine as we all are. Sister Runia in the Saturday evening talk also a insane talk that I am going to go study again as well. She said " Your direction is more important then your speed" how cool is that! As long as we are moving forward it is amazing so awesome keep going! It doesn't matter how fast forward you are going as long as you are going! And I am sure as a language learning missionaryyou could see why for me this is also so significant. I hope I didn't bore you too much with this email! I would love to hear from you guys! Thank you for your support! I hope you all have the best week and God be with you till we meet again! Also my Email title has nothing to do with my email they are just funny I guess haha.
Callate Monito,Oh man its been a crazy week! Oh where do I start! My spansih has been increasing every day and it's fantastic can I say it's good yet nope it's awful still but getting better I conto start conversations and ask them to church share scripture explain our church and thr book of Mormon! I also have started to do calls at night. We call people to check up on them see if they want to do a lesson and confirm that they are still wanting to go to church. I made my companions a little mad because they never get peopel to answer like ever and I can attest to that for them. But the first time I was doing solo calla with no help I got 6 people in a row to answer and 5 out of 6 to confirm to gonto church and one of them confirmed for a lesson! They were jealous. I was happy.This week I got to go on exchanges and I have been told I am in one of the toughest areas and I didn't belive it because it's pretty great and I love it. But for exchanges we get to go to another area and work with other companionships I went to Fairfield with the zone leader and it was a party! Also there were ao many people to talk to and tons of members and service! It was crazy we also got 4 new people in one day like what the heck! That is a regular thing for them we barely get 4 a week and it was clean and the roads were nice and they had a huge apartment compared to ours here. So I can now say that my area is slightly rough. But I still love it and still am very happy to be where I am and to be doing what I am doing! Now the fun stuff oh boy do I have a story for you guys. First as a trio companionship we decided to start running in the morning and my companions decided that they didn't like it I did but it's OK because on out run we discovered a basketball Court in a park right next to our apartment so we been balling up there instead of running in the morning it's been quite fun actually. Now the story.... So we were doing our normal stuff hitting up all the Spanish stores because that's where the Latinos are. We have one that we go to every day called the Economica we always meet cool peopel even if they don't want to go to church. After the Economica we walk to a laundry Mat where we also find cool Latinos but this time it was different. We walked up and there were some Latinos aonwe go in and immediately this black guy comes up to me and starts cussing at me I ignored him and found a Latino to talk to the guy kept cussing at me then my awesome comp stepped in and took the heat for me. Lots of cussing was happening and the conversation was going no where the guy was drunk and just wanted to be mad. I ended my talk with my friend early and we walked outside. We found a new Latino he was super cool but the black guy came outside and was yelling like loud and cussing up a storm at us yelling all thses horrible things and how we were awful people. It was bad then he started being racist twords out Latino friends totally not cool. Out Latino friend was very sympathetic and was telling us sorry for the guys I think our friend Lester will be coming to church and possibly a lesson but then.... Black guy said I am going to kill you all and starts to walk away possiby to get a gun. At that point everyone in the parking lot got in their car and left and we quickly walked away. 1 minute later two police cars zoom down the street and turn into the laundromat that we can still see and our friend Lester drove by us and made sure we were okay which was super cool of him. With this there is confimation that I am being watched over and protected by God and his angels that are watching over me and you always and that we are on the lords time not our own no matter how awesome or hard that it is. There's my story for the week haha. I also received a new nickname monito which means small monkey or cartoon. When they say it to me they mean small monkey haha. I received this name on exchanges when I called my trainer a monkey (mono in spanish) and then he called me monito and it stuck. So now I get told Callate Monito which means shut up little monkey haha! It's all a joke and quite funny! I will make the rest quick! I love teaching people about thr gospel it brings so much joy! To me and all the people we teach! I really love this church! The holy ghost speaks to everyone in different ways and times. I am striving to listen to the holy ghost in all that I do because it's an amazing thing to be able to have a member of the God head with you always! Prays are amazing they will be answered maybe not now and maybe not in the way you think but they will be. As we go through hard times which we all do we will grow and that's the point remember that. Here is a scripture that I like that I rediscovered 3 Nephi 27:29. love you all thank you all for the support you have given me! I hope things are good and would love to hear from you! May God be with you till we meet again Amigos! Hasta Luego! Sincerely Elder Barnes.
YOUR NEXT!,Hello my family and friends! I am back and still alive! Ready for another Email? I am not but here we go. This week was wired I feel like it was just yesterday that I was writing my last email but also it feels forever ago so I don't know. I had another day if exchanges this week and one tomorrow I had zone conference and met tons of new people! For exchanges on Thursday we did it with another trio and we did it here in out apartment so there were 6 Elders in on tiny apartment to give you an idea it take about 4 steps to get into a new room and 10 steps to cross the whole apartment so imagine 6 missionaries in a tiny apartment planning making food and finding places for everyone to sleep and then trying to run 6 of us around all day to say thr least it was crazy. Zone conference on Wednesday was cool it was my first one and it was pretty fun learned a lot and we were told how to begin preparing for the cold and dark days of winter which by the way humid cold wind is thr worst it goes straight through your clothes and I packed for Bolivia not Ohio so I don't have any warm clothes. Let's just say I am greatful to be in a car and not on a bike like the English Elder one of which got hit by a car. And during exchanges we had to take him to thr hospital which caused more crazyness for that day. Now My crazy weekend. Friday actually wasn't that crazy it was normal. But Saturday wow! So it started off normal did planning studying exercise and all of that then out to prosolite it was normal we talked to a lot of people no one was super interested but it was alright because after dinner we said out prayed stepped out of the car and a truck full of Latinos pulled up a bunch of Chapines(Guatemalans) so we naturally talked to them they weren't super interested in thr church but loved to talk and we were about to walk away when one of them was like hey let's take a picture so we took a picture haha. That was just the start. We went to the Pandoria (bakery) which also has a CVS and spanish store and ice cream shop next door. We hit all the Spanish places and we're headed to CVS we saw two Latinos get in a car to drive away so we hurred and pulled up next to them Elder Donnaldson hopped out and they said they would go to church! His name was Wakine(more on him soon). Then we go to these super sketchy apartments now it's dark and raining didn't help the sketch. But we all could fill the spirit and were like ok we are here for a reason let's go everyone in the whole complex was Latino!!! We talked to so many peopel we were there for over an hour! We had lots of church confirmation and some good mini lessons! Now comes Sunday we go to church no one is there. Just the group leader his wife and one other member. We had 8 new people confirm with us it was kinda disappointing. Then a part member family walked in and then Wakine called us and was like hey I am here where are you guys so we got him too! Itbwaa still 1/8 to show up but that's OK! Because after sacrament the part member family and Wakine wanted a lesson from us so we taught them all and our group leader joined. It was great. Our group leader his name is Brother Plasios he is a shorter wider man that doesn't make many expressions he is loud and very direct. His jokes are just him belittling people so that's also fun. Anyway My first week here in Sacrament he turns to my comp Elder Donnaldson while Elder Glade is Giving a talk and says Your next boy in a very scary way. Anyways yesterday I was told the same thing Elder Donnaldson was done praying he looks over at me locks eyes and Says Your Next. It was great and will forever be a joke in this trio. On Unsay I also did my first solo contact in spanish and he said he would love to have a lesson with us and we have it tonight!! I also have been teaching parts of lessons! So my spanish is improving but still is not great. It's alright though. Spiritual thought this week! Life as a missionary is hard sometimes. Life at home or at school or whenever you may can be quite difficult sometimes. I know that Heavenly father loves us knows of us and what we are going through. This scripture 2 Nephi 4:20 is true and will continue to be true for me. It says "My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness ; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep." We may metaphorical be lost in the wilderness or being tossed around on the waters of  Great deep and feel we may drown soon. but as in Nephi and his family were led by the lord and as Peter after walking on water was caught from and brought back to safety we all can and will be as well. Now we may be brought back but that doesn't mean we are going going stay there it may happen a few times and that is life it is all good we learn and we grow God will never tire from saving us and hearing from us he has a perfect love. I know this is all true the church. God. Jesus; the restoracion; the  book of Mormon; prophets; prayers; the gospel; the atonement; repentance; and everything else. Thank you for reading my email! You are all amazing peopel I would love to here from you! And thank you so much to those that have! Have a good week and God Be With You Till We Meet Again!
