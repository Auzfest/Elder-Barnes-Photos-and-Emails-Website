Week One in Provo!,The provo MTC is very cool and very pretty. It's been a very fun and exciting week. This week I got to meet my district and teachers in person which was amazing. I can now see them all clearly and hear them quite well.They are all also very amazing missionaries and have quickly become my best friends. I will stand by the fact that I have the best district. Just last night during a testimony meeting we made the Branch president cry from the amazing spirit felt. The spirit is everywhere and with everyone here it is so amazing. Sunday was the most spirit filled day of my life. I woke up with the spirit talking to me during my scripture study and for priesthood and for sacrament and then the whole time for the go and do experience. We then shared our testimonies and what we learned that day and the spirit was so strong we were all on a spiritual high. It was fantastic till the next morning when I was so exhausted. üòÇ The food here doesn't taste bad but it is definitely not the most nutritious and healthy food. I have been walking up and down many many stairs and then working out and playing lots of beach volleyball and court volleyball so lots of exercise and no nutrition means I shrink a whole size in everything my arms used to fit nicely in the shirt i am wearing as of 4 days ago and now it's slightly baggy my belts go tighter and my legs no longer fill my pants. I have grown spiritually but that's it. Hopefully I don't shrink too much more or I will be just bones. üíÄ Last night we got back to our resident hall and there were snails in the shower. It was very funny but also very gross. Some of the boys in my district and I took a picture with one of the snails in the shower. It was great. So as i mentioned before been playing lots of volleyball, I played basketball once and turns out MTC basketball in not very friendly and fun basketball i got hurt twice and shoved over many times that's why volleyball is the move I also destroy at volleyballüí™ I miss home and friends and family but I am still doing great, still surviving and enjoying life. Sounds like I will probably be getting reassigned at some point and I am actually looking forward to it so I can have more time to master my spanish. I love you all thankyou for all your prayers!‚ù§
